This is a tutorial on using cross-platform UI frameworks in Nodejs. The goal of this is to allow developers to use these frameworks to improve their apps.

------------------
## [Neutrino](https://replit.com/@StringentDev/Neutrino)
Neutrino uses webpack to build it's webservers. I set up a template with preinstalled modules (click the title and fork)

To use the template, go to `./src/app.js` to edit the main webpage. To edit the server functionality, go to `./src/index.js`. Any changes that you make will be applied by webpack.

|Advantages|Rating|
|--|--|
|Can be used to create websites with webpack bundles and SPA functionality| + |
|Small and lightweight                              | + |
|Cannot be used to create a standalone app          | - |

------------------
## [Electron](https://replit.com/@StringentDev/Electron)
Electron uses the chromium engine with nodejs integration to create stylish standalone apps with native interaction with the operating system. This framework has become more popular with companies like Discord, Microsoft, Github, Slack and Spotify using Electron.js to build their Desktop apps.

Using this template is similar to neutrino, with the source files also being in `./src` including `style.css`, `index.html` and the app script `index.js`.

|Advantages|Rating|
|--|--|
|Used to create standalone apps that require no external dependencies when built| + |
|Intricate and helpful documentation| + |
|Cannot build on repl.it so it is best to use github or your own computer to build your app| - |
|Resource intensive and occasionally slow| - |

If you want to use electron, be sure to check out its [documentation.](https://electronjs.org/docs)

------------------
## [NWJS](https://replit.com/@StringentDev/NWJS)
NWJS is a highly requested framework from multiple repliters, in which they asked me if we could port it over (yes, yes you can because I just did.) It is lighter than Electron but misses some features like standard support for npm modules, requiring you to go through some intricate and time consuming steps.

Using this template is the exact same to Electron, with the source files also being in `./src` including `style.css`, `index.html` and the app script `index.js`.

|Advantages|Rating|
|--|--|
|Used to create standalone apps that require no external dependencies when built| + |
|Easy to build for, might be able to build on  replit| + |
|Resource intensive and occasionally slow| - |
|Missing features| - |
|Not the best docs in the world - vague on API features | - |

## Final last words
_what waaa...?_
Hope this helps you develop your own unique applications that can be used offline, repl.it is more powerful than you think.
